# Camp3D: Learning Camera Path for Generative 3D Completion in the Wild
TL;DR: We propose a camera-conditional video diffusion model, namely "CamPainter", to reconstruct a real-world 3D object from only one incomplete image.


## Experiments
### Setting One: 3D generation from sparse multi-views
### Setting Two: 3D generation from one image
### Setting Three: 3D generation from one incomplete image
